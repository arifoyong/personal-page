//   // 1. **Early Concepts and Models (1950s-1970s):**
//   //    - The concept of machines mimicking human creativity dates back to the early days of AI.
//   //    - Initial work focused on rule-based systems and techniques like Markov Chains for text generation.

//   // 2. **Neural Networks (1980s-1990s):**
//   //    - With the development of neural networks, AI began to experiment with more sophisticated models.
//   //    - The introduction of backpropagation improved learning in neural networks, setting the stage for future advances.

//   // 3. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and GANs (2010s):**
//   //    - The introduction of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) allowed for effective generative modeling by learning latent representations of data.
//   //    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, revolutionized generative modeling. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete to create realistic data.

//   // 4. **Transformers and NLP (Late 2010s-2020s):**
//   //    - The development of transformer architectures, as seen in models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) by OpenAI, advanced text generation significantly.
//   //    - Transformers, with their attention mechanisms, improved both language understanding and generation.

//   // 5. **Advancements and Applications:**
//   //    - Generative AI models have been extended to other domains, including image synthesis (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) and music generation.
//   //    - These models are increasingly used in various applications, from creative industries to automating tasks in businesses.

//   // Generative AI continues to evolve, driving innovation in how we interact with technology and automate creative processes.`
